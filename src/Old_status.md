## üü¶ Square API Integration

### Overview
The application uses **Square Production API exclusively** for all wine catalog and customer data. This eliminates environment switching complexity and ensures live, accurate inventory data.

### Square API Architecture

**Integration Approach: Live Inventory**
- Square is the single source of truth for wine data
- No local storage of wine names, prices, images, or descriptions
- Only Square item IDs are stored when wines are assigned to shipments
- Real-time fetching on every inventory view

**Benefits:**
- Always current with Square catalog updates
- No data sync issues or stale information
- Automatic price and inventory updates
- Simplified database schema

### Square API Files

#### Backend (Supabase Edge Functions)

**`/supabase/functions/server/square-live-inventory.tsx`**
- **Purpose:** Fetches live wine inventory from Square Production catalog
- **Endpoints:**
  - `GET /square/live-inventory/:wineClubId` - Returns wines with filters
  - `GET /square/debug/:wineClubId` - Connection testing and diagnostics
  - `GET /square/health/:wineClubId` - Quick health check
- **Data Returned:**
  - Wine items with variations (sizes, prices)
  - Categories (excluding "Uncategorized")
  - Images from Square catalog
  - Total inventory counts
- **Key Functions:**
  - `getSquareConfig()` - Loads Square credentials (production only)
  - `parseSquareCatalog()` - Transforms Square API response to app format
  - `getCustomAttribute()` - Extracts wine attributes (varietal, sweetness, color)

## ‚è≥ Pending: Customer Embedded Flow

### Overview
The customer-facing experience will be delivered via **embedded scripts** on the wine club's Square website, allowing seamless integration without redirecting users to a separate domain.

### Required Setup: Two Authorized Domains

Each wine club will need to authorize **two domains** in the Square application settings:

1. **Square Subdomain** - For testing and Square Online Store integration
   - Example: `kingfrosch.square.site`
   - Used during initial setup and development

2. **Custom Domain** - For production customer experience
   - Example: `club.kingfroschwines.com` or `www.kingfroschwines.com`
   - Used for final customer-facing embedded scripts

**Why Two Domains?**
- Square Online Store has built-in subdomain
- Custom domain provides professional branding
- Both need CORS authorization for embedded scripts to work

### Embedded Script 1: Wine Club Signup

**Purpose:** Allow customers to join the wine club directly from the winery's website

**User Flow:**
1. Customer visits winery website
2. Clicks "Join Wine Club" button (embedded widget)
3. **Signup Modal Opens:**
   - Select subscription plan (Gold/Silver/Platinum)
   - Enter personal information (name, email, phone)
   - Set wine preferences (categories, quantities)

```

**Free Signup with Payment Method:**
- No charge at signup (free to join)
