```

---

## Step 8: Push to GitHub

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If prompted for credentials:

   - 91+ files in the repository

---

## Step 10: Set Up Branch Protection (Optional but Recommended)

## Quick Command Summary

For copy/paste convenience:

```bash
# Step 3-8 in one block
git init
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit - Complete Wine Club SaaS with Square integration"
git remote add origin https://github.com/creatorstudioshq/wine-club-saas.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Future Commits

After your initial commit, use this workflow:

```bash
# See what changed
git status

# Add specific files
git add components/PlansPage.tsx
git add ROADMAP.md

# Or add all changes
git add .

# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "fix: Resolve edit/delete buttons on Plans page"

# Push to GitHub
git push
```

---

## Commit Message Convention

Use these prefixes for clarity:

- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only
- `style:` Formatting, missing semicolons, etc.
- `refactor:` Code restructuring
- `test:` Adding tests
- `chore:` Maintenance tasks

Examples:
```bash
git commit -m "feat: Add customer payment processing with Square SDK"
git commit -m "fix: Resolve authentication token expiration issue"
git commit -m "docs: Update deployment guide in ROADMAP"
git commit -m "refactor: Simplify inventory API call structure"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Error: "remote origin already exists"
```bash
git remote remove origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/creatorstudioshq/wine-club-saas.git
```

### Error: "failed to push some refs"
```bash
# If remote has changes you don't have locally
git pull origin main --rebase
git push
```

### Error: "Permission denied"
- Make sure you're using a Personal Access Token (not password)
- Verify you have write access to the `creatorstudioshq` organization

### Want to see commit history?
```bash
git log --oneline
```

### Want to undo last commit (before push)?
```bash
git reset --soft HEAD~1
```
